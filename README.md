Oatnet is an in-development utility application for Food Not Bombs Boston

A demo instance of Oatnet is available at [oatnet.xyz](https://oatnet.xyz/)!

## Right now Oatnet + Oatnet-Server can be used to:

* Save, retrieve and delete inventory items
* Search for existing items
* Set the "have" and "need" values for each item  
* Tag an item as needing to be checked weekly via a settings panel
* Display a report of inventory items with filters to show all, weekly or needed items
* Edit items in the reports by clicking/tapping them
* Navigate through the parts of the application and link to items/report filters via routes and URL query parameters

## In the future, Oatnet + Oatnet-Server should:

* Authenticate users using usernames and passwords
* Support user-specific preferences
* Support a variety of units for items, converting between them when different units are selected
