Oatnet is an in-development utility application for Food Not Bombs Boston

## Right now Oatnet can be used to:

* Save, retrieve and delete inventory items
* Search for existing items
* Set the "have" and "need" values for each item
* Tag an item as needing to be checked weekly
* Display a report of inventory items with filters to show all, weekly or needed items
* Edit items in the reports by clicking/tapping them
* Navigate through the parts of the application and link to pages via routes and URL query parameters
* Authenticate users using usernames and passwords
* Manage read and write permissions of users through an administrator panel
* Note how many of an item is used weekly
* Support units for items

## In the future, Oatnet should:

* Support user-specific preferences
* Convert between units when different units are selected
