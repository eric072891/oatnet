## Oatnet

Oatnet is an in-development utility application for Food Not Bombs Boston

## Right now Oatnet + Oatnet-Server can:

Push and pull inventory items based on user input  
Set the have and need values for each item, as well as increment and decrement the values with buttons  
Use user input to suggest items
Tag an item to check weekly, get a report of all needed items
Print a formatted table of everything in the database
Allow the user to open a panel to configure extra parameters for items, such as type, location, needed per week, etc.
Allow users to navigate the parts of the application via routes

## In the future, Oatnet + Oatnet-Server should:

Authenticate users using usernames and passwords, and block unauthenticated DB interactions
Support a variety of units through a dropdown box  
Convert between units when different units are selected
Have user-specific preferences
